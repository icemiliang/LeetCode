### 337\.[House Robber III](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/)

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1

Output: 7 
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \   \ 
 1   3   1

Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
```

#### Solution 1

Directly follow the question in a recursive manner. The helper function
return the max following the current node. It also returns the max of its
left and right nodes. Each time, we can choose either 1) rob the current
node and four grand children or 2) its two children.

C++

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(TreeNode* root) {
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        return dfs(root, left, right);
    }
    
    int dfs(TreeNode* root, int& l, int& r) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        int ll = 0, lr = 0, rl = 0, rr = 0;
        l = dfs(root->left, ll, lr);
        r = dfs(root->right, rl, rr);
        return max(l + r, root->val + ll + lr + rl + rr);
    }
};
```
