### 232\. [Implement Queue using Stacks](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)

Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

* push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
* pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
* peek() -- Get the front element.
* empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
Example:
```
MyQueue queue = new MyQueue();

queue.push(1);
queue.push(2);  
queue.peek();  // returns 1
queue.pop();   // returns 1
queue.empty(); // returns false
```

Notes:

* You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
* Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
* You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).

#### Solution 1

Two stacks one for storing input, one for output.
Push new elements to input. Pop elements from output.
If output is empty, put everything in input to output.

C++

```
class MyQueue {
    stack<int> in, out;
public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    MyQueue() {
        
    }
    
    /** Push element x to the back of queue. */
    void push(int x) {
        in.push(x);
    }
    
    /** Removes the element from in front of queue and returns that element. */
    int pop() {
        int res = peek();
        out.pop();
        return res;
    }
    
    /** Get the front element. */
    int peek() {
        if (out.empty()) {
            while (!in.empty()) {
                out.push(in.top());
                in.pop();
            }
        }
        return out.top();
    }
    
    /** Returns whether the queue is empty. */
    bool empty() {
        return in.empty() and out.empty();
    }
};

/**
 * Your MyQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MyQueue* obj = new MyQueue();
 * obj->push(x);
 * int param_2 = obj->pop();
 * int param_3 = obj->peek();
 * bool param_4 = obj->empty();
 */
```
