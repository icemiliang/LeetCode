### 389\. [Find the Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:
```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```

#### Solution 1

Use an 26-element array to count frequencies. 
Hash all the chars of s. Loop t and return the 1st frequency = -1 char.
```
class Solution {
public:
	char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
		int count[26] = {0};
		for (char i : s) count[i-'a']++;
		for (char i : t) if (count[i-'a']-- == 0) return i;
		return 0;
	}
};
```

#### Solution 2

Do Bitwise OR of every char of s and t.

```
class Solution {
public:
	char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
		char res = 0;
		for (char i : s) res ^= i;
		for (char i : t) res ^= i;
		return res;
	}
};
```

```
class Solution {
public:
	char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
		return accumulate(begin(s), end(s += t), 0, bit_xor<int>());
	}
};
```

#### Solution 3

Starting from 0, minus all the chars of s, and add all the chars of t.
All the chars will cancel out except the extra one.

```
class Solution {
public:
	char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
		char res = 0;
		for (char i : s) res -= i;
		for (char i : t) res += i;
		return res;
	}
};
```
